  <h1>Getting Started</h1>

  <p>
    To get started, download a copy of the HanziWriter javascript <strong><a href="https://github.com/chanind/hanzi-writer/blob/master/dist/hanzi-writer.min.js">Here</a></strong>. Including this JS file in your web page will
    make available a global HanziWriter class.
  </p>

  <h2>Loading Character Data</h2>

  <p>
    On its own, the HanziWriter JS file isn't enough to render characters. You also need to load the corresponding character data for any character you wish to display. There are several ways to do this. In the Hanzi Writer repo there is a <a href="https://github.com/chanind/hanzi-writer/tree/master/dist/data">data</a> folder which contains all the character data for each character in several different formats.
  </p>
  <p>
    The easiest method is to simply include the <a href="https://github.com/chanind/hanzi-writer/blob/master/dist/data/all.js">all.js</a> file in your webpage which includes all the data for every character and puts it in a global variable accessible to the HanziWriter. The all.js file is about 4.5MB so it's not recommended to use this method for production web sites. This should be fine if HanziWriter is used in a webview in a mobile app, however. There is also an <a href="https://github.com/chanind/hanzi-writer/blob/master/dist/data/all.json">all.json</a> version if you would prefer to load this data via JSON.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/chanind/hanzi-writer/tree/master/dist/data">data</a> folder also includes the data for each individual character as a separate JSON file. You can use host these files from your server and load them via AJAX inside of HanziWriter however you see fit. Loading character data is way is accomplished via passing a custom closure to `charDataLoader`. An example is shown below using jQuery:
  </p>

  {% highlight javascript %}
var writer = new HanziWriter('target', '我', {
  charDataLoader: function(char, onComplete) {
    $.getJSON("/my/server/" + char + ".json", onComplete);
  }
});
  {% endhighlight %}
